Help: lfundiv(ldata1,ldata2): creates the ldata structure (without
  initialization) corresponding to the quotient of the Dirichlet series
  given by ldata1 and ldata2.
Doc: creates the ldata structure (without initialization) corresponding
  to the quotient of the Dirichlet series $L_1$ and $L_2$ given by
 \kbd{ldata1} and \kbd{ldata2}. Assume that $v_z(L_1) \geq v_z(L_2)$ at all
 complex numbers $z$: the construction may not create new poles, nor increase
 the order of existing ones.
