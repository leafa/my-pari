Function: lfunsymsq
Section: l_functions
C-Name: lfunsymsq
Prototype: GDGp
Help: lfunsymsq(ldata,{known=[]}): creates the ldata corresponding to the
  symmetric square of the modular form ldata, including the search for the
  conductor and bad Euler factors. known, if present, is the vector
  [conductor,[list of Euler factors]], where each Euler factor is of the form
  [p, a_p] corresponding to the factor 1/(1 - a_pp^(-s)). The result can
  then be used with the usual lfunxxx functions. Warning: in the present
  implementation, only missing Euler factors of degree at most 1 are
  supported (this is sufficient in most cases, and always if N is squarefree).
