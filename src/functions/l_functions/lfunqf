Function: lfunqf

C-Name: lfunqf
Prototype: G
Help: lfunqf(Q): returns the Linit structure associated to the
 theta function of the lattice associated to the definite positive quadratic
 form Q. This function assumes that the associated L function is self-dual,
 but not necessarily the lattice itself. In particular, if Q is
 two-dimensional, then L is always self-dual.
